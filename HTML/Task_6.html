       The show revolves around Bheem and his team using their skills to solve various problems affecting the village, unravel mysteries, fight evil villains that seek to harm Dholakpur and/or its inhabitants, or foil the plans of their rivals Kalia, Dholu, and Bholu, who aim to embarrass Bheem. Their antics also sometimes get them into trouble.
